# Kazakhstan-warner
Warns users from Kazakhstan that their internet connection is not secure.

As of January 1st, the Kazakh government will have the power to spy on virtually any internet user in the country.  By law, any device capable of accessing the Internet will be forced to install a government-issued security certificate, and internet access to those not in compliance will be shut off.  This allows the federal government to perform routine man-in-the-middle attacks against its citizens.

Even though Kazakhstan is a small country that does not have a large global technology presence, an attack on an entire country of intenet users is an attack on us all.  If the government is allowed to get away with this, this practice could spread to other countries.

By installing Kazakhstan Warner on your site, you take a stand against this by warning users from Kazakhstan that their internet line is insecure.
